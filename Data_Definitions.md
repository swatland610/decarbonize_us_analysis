This Data is pulled from the World Resources Institute [WRI Climate Watch](https://datasets.wri.org/dataset/climate-watch-states-greenhouse-gas-emissions).

#### Quick Description from WRI
_The Climate Watch U.S. States GHG emissions collection applies a consistent methodology to create a six-gas, multi-sector, and comparable data set for all 50 U.S. states and District of Columbia_

#### Goal with the data
We want to answer where are greenhouse gases are coming from and simply roll up greenhouse gas emissions by the following caterogies:
* Dity Power Plants
* Builings (commerical & residential)
* Transportation (cars, buses, etc...)
* Dumps, Farms, & Industry

## Electricity Generation by Fuel Type
